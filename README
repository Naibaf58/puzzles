Puzzles-HTML
============

**Work In Progress**

This is an HTML/JavaScript port of
[Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/)

Cross-compilation to JS uses [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

Puzzles are known to run on:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Internet Explorer 9 (and later, presumably)
* Internet Explorer 8 (albeit slowly)
* iPad (tested on iPad 1 with Safari 5)
* Android 3.2
